安装及配置 ProxyChains-NG 实现终端下代理

安装好 proxychains4 之后，建立默认配置，指向本地 shadowsocks 建立的 socks5 代理。

Install and test proxychains-ng (or proxychains4) in Ubuntu 15.04

* To download, compile and set-up do the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# if you havent done it yet, please download the tor-browser and start it
# https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en
wget https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/5.0/tor-browser-linux64-5.0_en-US.tar.xz
tar xf tor-browser-linux64-5.0_en-US.tar.xz

# download the source of proxychains-ng
git clone https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng.git

cd proxychains-ng

# configure and install
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
make
sudo make install
sudo make install-config # installs /etc/proxychains.conf

# I've noticed that is better to change one default line
# in /etc/proxychains.conf to what tor browser (i.e. firefox)
# is using as can be seen here: http://i.imgur.com/pKuqHPU.jpg

sudo gedit /etc/proxychains.conf
Chanege last line in the file:
from “socks4     127.0.0.1 9050” to “socks5     127.0.0.1 9150”

# to test if proxychains4 goes through tor
# we can do two simple tests. For this we need elinks and iftop

sudo apt-get install elinks iftop
#+END_SRC

* To test the proxychain

For example using iftop. Run iftop in a second terminal window:
sudo iftop
Now run
elinks https://ipleak.net/
and check what you see in both the elinks and iftop. 
You should see your real IP in the ipleak test, and iftop should show that 
you are directly connecting to ipleak.net as shown below: 

Now do the same through proxychain:
proxychains4 elinks https://ipleak.net/

And we should see that iftop shows we are connection to an entry tor node, 
and elinks should show are tor ID, instead of real one.
