Scan your server for rootkits with rkhunter

rkhunter (Rootkit Hunter) is a tool that scans for rootkits, backdoors and
possible local exploits. It does this by comparing SHA-1 hashes of important
files with known good ones in online database,
searching for default directories (of rootkits), wrong permissions,
hidden files, suspicious strings in kernel modules, and special tests for Linux
and FreeBSD.

* 1. Install rkhunter
#+BEGIN_SRC
apt-get install rkhunter
#+END_SRC

* 2. Run rkhunter to check your server
#+BEGIN_SRC
rkhunter --check
#+END_SRC
