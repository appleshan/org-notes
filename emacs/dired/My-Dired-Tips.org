#+TITLE:Emacs Dired Tips

I’m using Emacs 23.1, primarily on Windows 7, and want to make a note of some
Dired tips for my own use.

! will run a shell command on the marked files or the file at point.

So, to look at the end of a log file on a remote server (and since I have
Cygwin installed):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
! tail RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

To copy the name of the file at point, in order to make use of it elsewhere,
use dired-copy-filename-as-kill, which is bound to w. To make it copy the
absolute path:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
0 w
#+END_EXAMPLE

To copy the path to the folder you’re looking at in dired:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-< w
#+END_EXAMPLE

To create an archive of the currently marked files using 7zip:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
! 7z a zipfilename * RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

To extract the archive of the file at point:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
! 7z e * RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

UPDATE: here’s another one I keep forgetting to use.

From dired, to search for files containing a string, just do this, remembering
that your regexp will be case-sensitive:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x find-grep-dired
#+END_EXAMPLE
