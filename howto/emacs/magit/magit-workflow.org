#+TITLE: How to simplifying magit workflow?

@see https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/56ntg0/how_to_simplifying_magit_workflow/

    I love magit and use it daily. 80% of my uses are covered by the following workflow:

    1. C-c m: run magit
    2. S: stage everything
    3. c c: commit
    4. <<type in commit message>>
    5. C-c C-c: commit
    6. P p: push to origin/master
    7. q: exit magit

    What is the simplest way to bind this whole workflow into 2 key strokes? E.g.
F7 for steps 1.-3., <<type commit message>>, F7 for steps 5. - 7.
Thanks!
