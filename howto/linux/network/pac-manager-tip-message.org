WARNING: Tray icon may not be available:
If on Unity, try installing 'libgtk2-appindicator-perl' package.
If on Gnome3 gnome-shell, you may need to install some extension like 'Evil Status Icon Forever' in order to be able to see PAC's tray icon.
This message will not appear anymore.
See tooltip of 'Preferences' -> 'PAC Main Options' -> 'Behaviour' -> 'At PAC Exit' -> 'Hide to tray instead of closing'
You may reenable Tray icon options under 'Preferences'.
