#+TITLE:Checking for existing SSH keys

Before you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing
SSH keys.

1. Open Terminal.

2. Enter ls -al ~/.ssh to see if existing SSH keys are present:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
#+END_EXAMPLE

2. Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key.

By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

- id_dsa.pub
- id_ecdsa.pub
- id_ed25519.pub
- id_rsa.pub

If you don't have an existing public and private key pair, or don't wish to use
any that are available to connect to GitHub, then [[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent][generate a new SSH key]].

If you see an existing public and private key pair listed (for example
id_rsa.pub and id_rsa) that you would like to use to connect to GitHub, you can
