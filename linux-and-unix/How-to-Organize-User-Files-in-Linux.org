* Intended User
Every computer user should know where their data is stored and create proper
backup for their data. User purchased or created data is the most valuable
thing to backup in a computer. Today, computers are used in many areas and
users usually download or create many files when using a computer. If you are
happy with how computer handle your files now, you may ignore this post.
On the other hand, if you have lots of file to organize, don't know where you
should put things and often forget where you put things, this post could help
out. I will talk file system and directory structure in Linux, since that's
what I use. Some concepts can be used in other OS, but I won't go into the
details of applying it to other OS.

* Type of Files
Before I talk about the real thing, you should know there are different type
of files. Usually we use different dir to store them.

Based on the creator of the file, there are

- User created files, such as text files, spreadsheet, drawings, diagrams.
- Transferred file or downloaded file, such as photos, movies, songs, documents
  sent to you by other friends.
- Program managed files, such as a database.
- Programs. Usually we are not interested in these files.

Based on the uniqueness of the file, there are

- Easy to get files. Publicly distributed, products from high profile company.
  Such as the JDK installer, drivers for your graphic card.
- Files shared for a group of people. Such as travel photos,
  company administration documents.
- Files created and owned privately by yourself.

* The directory layout
Usually I just put these dirs in HOME dir.
