Change sudo password timeout in Ubuntu:

Changing the default sudo password timeout in Ubuntu is very easy.
Even beginners can do it. All you have to do is to open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
and use the following command:

sudo visudo
It will open a file in nano text editor that contains some settings related to
sudo. In here look for the following line:

Defaults        env_reset
Replace above line with this one:

Defaults        env_reset, timestamp_timeout=XX
Where XX is the new timeout value in minutes. Of course you have to replace
the XX with the desired timeout value.
