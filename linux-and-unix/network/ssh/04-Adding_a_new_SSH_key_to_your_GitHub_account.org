#+TITLE:Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account

To configure your GitHub account to use your new (or existing) SSH key, you'll
also need to add it to your GitHub account.

Before adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account, you should have:

- [[https://help.github.com/articles/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys][Checked for existing SSH keys]]
- [[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent][Generated a new SSH key and added it to the ssh-agent]]

1. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.

If your SSH key file has a different name than the example code, modify
the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any
newlines or whitespace.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ sudo apt-get install xclip
# Downloads and installs xclip. If you don't have `apt-get`, you might need to use another installer (like `yum`)

$ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard
#+END_SRC

Tip: If =xclip= isn't working, you can locate the hidden =.ssh= folder,
open the file in your favorite text editor, and copy it to your clipboard.

2. In the top right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click =Settings=.

if you're using a personal Mac, you might call this key "Personal MacBook Air".
