#+TITLE: GOOGLE CHROME AS DEFAULT BROWSER ON ARCH LINUX

@See https://ikacikax.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/google-chrome-as-default-browser-on-arch-linux/

Then I stumbled upon this solution:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/opt/google/chrome/xdg-settings get default-web-browser
/opt/google/chrome/xdg-settings check default-web-browser google-chrome.desktop
#+END_SRC
Here you can check which is your default browser and change it.

It worked for me, and I hope itâ€™ll work for you too ðŸ™‚

Other solutions were:

 - Exporting system variable BROWSER with path to your browser as itâ€™s value
 - Setting variable in your ~/.profile file (or ~/.bashrc)

Anyway, thatâ€™s it. Bye!
