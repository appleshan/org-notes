#+TITLE: How to Install Go 1.7 on Ubuntu 16.10

[[https://golang.org/][Go]] is an open source programming language developed by a team at Google. It
provides easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient softwares. This language
is designed for writing servers, that’s why it is using widely these days. Go
has released latest version 1.7. This tutorial will help you to install Go 1.7.5
on your Ubuntu 16.10 systems.

* Step 1 — Install Go Language

Login to your Ubuntu system using ssh and upgrade to apply latest security
updates there.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
#+END_SRC

Now download the Go language binary archive file using following link. To find
and download latest version available or 32 bit version go to official download
page.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

Now extract the downloaded archive and install it to the desired location on
the system. For this tutorial, I am installing it under /usr/local directory.
You can also put this under the home directory (for shared hosting) or other
location.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ sudo tar -xvf go1.7.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ sudo mv go /usr/local
#+END_SRC

or

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ sudo tar -xvf go1.7.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ mv ./go ./go-1.7.5
$ sudo mv go-1.7.5 /opt/golang/go-1.7.5
#+END_SRC

* Step 2 — Setup Go Environment

Now you need to setup Go language environment variables for your project.
Commonly you need to set 3 environment variables as GOROOT, GOPATH and PATH.

GOROOT is the location where Go package is installed on your system.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
#+END_SRC

GOPATH is the location of your work directory. For example my project directory
is ~/Projects/Proj1 .
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/Projects/Proj1
#+END_SRC

Now set the PATH variable to access go binary system wide.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
#+END_SRC

All above environment will be set for your current session only. To make it
permanent add above commands in ~/.profile file.

* Step 3 — Verify Installation

At this step, you have successfully installed and configured go language on your
system. First use the following command to check Go version.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ go version
go version go1.7.5 linux/amd64
#+END_SRC

Now also verify all configured environment variables using following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ go env
GOARCH="amd64"
GOBIN=""
GOEXE=""
GOHOSTARCH="amd64"
GOHOSTOS="linux"
GOOS="linux"
GOPATH="/home/tecadmin/Projects/Proj1"
GORACE=""
GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
GOTOOLDIR="/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64"
CC="gcc"
GOGCCFLAGS="-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build661994963=/tmp/go-build"
CXX="g++"
CGO_ENABLED="1"
#+END_SRC
